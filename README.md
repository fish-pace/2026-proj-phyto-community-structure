# Readme For Phytoplankton Community Structure project

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets. 

## Project Name: Phytoplankton Community Structure

## One-line Description

This project will look at blooms along the East Coast of the United States. We will select 3 blooms in Mass Bay, Florida, and Chesapeake Bay. Field data will be used to identify bloom location, extent and timing. We will select PACE data and look at spectra, standard chl, etc algorithms for bloom detection/separation.

## Background

## Goals

Examine differences in reflectance spectra between a few high biomass blooms on the East Coast of the US

## Datasets

MD/VA State phytoplankton data
MA State phytoplankton data
FL State phytoplankton data
OLCI imagery to identify potential clear dates for PACE, and bloom extent and timing

## Workflow/Roadmap

[ ] Gather state datesets to identify bloom location and relevant dates
[ ] Identify key dates for a few key blooms, and create Chl image from PACE (may look at other products if time allows
[ ] Extract spectra at bloom locations and start to analyze differences

## Results/Findings
